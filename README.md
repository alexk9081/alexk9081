### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alex, and I am a Computer Science major at the University of North Florida. Currently, I am the most proficient in **Java** but I have experience working on projects using  **Python, C, and JavaScript**.  
  
My school and personal projects are posted here, and my current focus is working on backend projects especially those involving databases and scaling.
